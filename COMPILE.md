You will need Visual Studio to build, debug, and release this application. VS Community Edition 2022 was used to setup this project successfully.

Chose the `.NET desktop development` option when you install it.

# Run

Open the `EVE-O Multiview.sln` file in Visual Studio, and then click Run at the top. It should build and execute.

# Test

I don't see any unit tests, so this might be new. Stay tuned.

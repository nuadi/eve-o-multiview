# Overview

This is an unofficial fork of the EVE-O-Preview application. For the official repository and current maintainer, please head over to https://github.com/EveOPlus/eve-o-preview

The purpose of this application is to provide a simple way to keep an eye on several simultaneously-running EVE Online clients and to easily switch between them. While running, it shows a set of live thumbnails for each of the active EVE Online clients. These thumbnails allow fast switching to the corresponding EVE Online client either using mouse or configurable hotkeys.

It's essentially a task switcher. It does not relay any keyboard/mouse events. The application works with EVE, EVE through Steam, or any combination thereof.

The program does NOT (and will NOT ever) do the following things:

* modify the EVE Online interface
* display a modified EVE Online interface
* broadcast any keyboard or mouse events
* interact with EVE Online except for bringing a client window to the foreground or resizing/minimizing it

**Under no condition should you use EVE-O Multiview for any actions that would break the EULA or ToS of EVE Online.**

If you find out that some of the features or their combination of EVE-O Multiview might cause actions that can be considered as breaking the EULA or ToS of EVE Online, you should consider them as a bug and immediately notify the Developer via in-game mail.

# How To Install & Use

1. Download and extract the contents of the .zip archive to a location of your choice (ie: Desktop, CCP folder, etc)
    * **Note**: Please do not install the application into the *Program Files* or *Program files (x86)* folders. These folders in general do not allow applications to write anything there while EVE-O Multiview now stores its configuration file next to its executable, thus requiring the write access to the folder it is installed into.
1. Start up both EVE-O Multiview and your EVE Clients (the order does not matter)
1. Set EVE clients Display Mode to **Fixed Window** or **Window Mode**
1. Adjust settings as you see fit. Program options are described below

## Configuration File-Only Options

Some of the application options are not exposed in the GUI. They can be adjusted directly in the configuration file.

**Note:** Do any changes to the configuration file only while the EVE-O Multiview itself is closed. Otherwise the changes you made might be lost.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **ActiveClientHighlightThickness** | <div style="font-size: small">Thickness of the border used to highlight the active client's thumbnail.<br />Allowed values are **1**...**6**.<br />The default value is **3**<br />For example: **"ActiveClientHighlightThickness": 3**</div> |
| **CompatibilityMode** | <div style="font-size: small">Enables the alternative render mode (see below)<br />The default value is **false**<br />For example: **"CompatibilityMode": true**</div> |
| **EnableThumbnailSnap** | <div style="font-size: small">Allows to disable thumbnails snap feature by setting its value to **false**<br />The default value is **true**<br />For example: **"EnableThumbnailSnap": true**</div> |
| **HideThumbnailsDelay** | <div style="font-size: small">Delay before thumbnails are hidden if the **General** -> **Hide previews when EVE client is not active** option is enabled<br />The delay is measured in thumbnail refresh periods<br />The default value is **2** (corresponds to 1 second delay)<br />For example: **"HideThumbnailsDelay": 2**</div> |
| **PriorityClients** | <div style="font-size: small">Allows to set a list of clients that are not auto-minimized on inactivity even if the **Minimize inactive EVE clients** option is enabled. Listed clients still can be minimized using Windows hotkeys or via _Ctrl+Click_ on the corresponding thumbnail<br />The default value is empty list **[]**<br />For example: **"PriorityClients": [ "EVE - Phrynohyas Tig-Rah", "EVE - Ondatra Patrouette" ]**</div> |
| **ThumbnailMinimumSize** | <div style="font-size: small">Minimum thumbnail size that can be set either via GUI or by resizing a thumbnail window. Value is written in the form "width, height"<br />The default value is **"100, 80"**.<br />For example: **"ThumbnailMinimumSize": "100, 80"**</div> |

| **ThumbnailRefreshPeriod** | <div style="font-size: small">Thumbnail refresh period in milliseconds. This option accepts values between **300** and **1000** only.<br />The default value is **500** milliseconds.<br />For example: **"ThumbnailRefreshPeriod": 500**</div> |

## Hotkey Setup

It is possible to set a key combinations to immediately jump to certain EVE window. However currently EVE-O Multiview doesn't provide any GUI to set the these hotkeys. It should be done via editing the configuration file directly. Don't forget to make a backup copy of the file before editing it.

**Note**: Don't forget to make a backup copy of the file before editing it.

Open the file using any text editor. find the entry **ClientHotkey**. Most probably it will look like

    "ClientHotkey": {},

This means that no hotkeys are defined. Edit it to be like

    "ClientHotkey": {
      "EVE - Phrynohyas Tig-Rah": "F1",
      "EVE - Ondatra Patrouette": "F2"
    }

This simple edit will assign **F1** as a hotkey for Phrynohyas Tig-Rah and **F2** as a hotkey for Ondatra Patrouette, so pressing F1 anywhere in Windows will immediately open EVE client for Phrynohyas Tig-Rah if he is logged on.

The following hotkey is described as `modifier+key` where `modifier` can be **Control**, **Alt**, **Shift**, or their combination. F.e. it is possible to setup the hotkey as

    "ClientHotkey": {
      "EVE - Phrynohyas Tig-Rah": "F1",
      "EVE - Ondatra Patrouette": "Control+Shift+F4"
    }

**Note:** Do not set hotkeys to use the key combinations already used by EVE. It won't work as "_I set hotkey for my DPS char to F1 and when I'll press F1 it will automatically open the DPS char's window and activate guns_". Key combination will be swallowed by EVE-O Multiview and NOT retranslated to EVE window. So it will be only "_it will automatically open the DPS char's window_".

## Compatibility Mode

This setting allows to enable an alternate thumbnail render. This render doesn't use advanced DWM API to create live previews. Instead it is a screenshot-based render with the following pros and cons:
* `+`  Should work even in remote desktop environments
* `-`  Consumes significantly more memory. In the testing environment EVE-O Multiview did consume around 180 MB to manage 3 thumbnails using this render. At the same time the primary render did consume around 50 MB when run in the same environment.
* `-`  Thumbnail images are refreshed at 1 FPS rate
* `-`  Possible short mouse cursor freezes
